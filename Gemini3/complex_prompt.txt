Create a Manim animation illustrating the topological concept of a Klein Bottle and its relation to a Möbius Strip.
The animation should:
1. Start by visualizing a 2D Möbius Strip being formed from a rectangular strip.
2. Evolve into a 3D visualization of a Klein Bottle, showing its "impossible" self-intersection in 3D space.
3. Use a grid or parametric surface to clearly show the curvature and single-sided nature.
4. Animate a small particle traversing the surface to demonstrate that it can visit both "sides" without crossing an edge (non-orientability).
5. Include mathematical annotations for the parametric equations of the Klein Bottle.
6. Use a color scheme that highlights the geometry (e.g., semi-transparent surface with wireframe).
7. End with the object rotating to show all angles.
