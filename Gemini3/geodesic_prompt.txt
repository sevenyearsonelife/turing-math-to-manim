Create a gorgeous, cinematic 3D Manim animation explaining the Geodesic Equation.

Visual Style:
- Use a 3D scene (ThreeDScene).
- Set the background color to an elegant off-white (e.g., "#F0F0F0" or similar) with dark text/math (BLACK or darker gray) for high contrast.
- Use smooth camera movements (ambient_camera_rotation) to showcase the 3D nature.

Content to Animate:
1. Title: "Geodesic Equation" (bold, elegant font).
2. The Main Equation:
   $\frac{d^2x^\alpha}{d\tau^2} + \Gamma^\alpha_{\beta\gamma} \frac{dx^\beta}{d\tau} \frac{dx^\gamma}{d\tau} = 0$
   - Explain that this describes a particle's motion under gravity in General Relativity.
   - Highlight the terms:
     - $\frac{d^2x^\alpha}{d\tau^2}$: Acceleration / 4-acceleration.
     - $\Gamma^\alpha_{\beta\gamma}$: Christoffel symbols (encodes curvature).
     - $\frac{dx^\beta}{d\tau}, \frac{dx^\gamma}{d\tau}$: Velocity / 4-velocity components.

3. The Christoffel Symbol Definition:
   $\Gamma^\alpha_{\beta\gamma} = \frac{1}{2}g^{\alpha\delta}(\frac{\partial g_{\delta\beta}}{\partial x^\gamma} + \frac{\partial g_{\delta\gamma}}{\partial x^\beta} - \frac{\partial g_{\beta\gamma}}{\partial x^\delta})$
   - Show this appearing below or connected to the main equation.
   - Annotate "spacetime metric" ($g_{\alpha\delta}$) and its derivatives.

4. 3D Visualization:
   - Illustrate the concept with a curved surface (e.g., a sphere or a parametric surface) in 3D.
   - Show a "particle" (a dot) moving along a geodesic (shortest path) on this surface vs a non-geodesic path.
   - Visualize tangent vectors or normal vectors if it helps explain the "straightest possible line" concept in curved space.

Make the transitions smooth and the explanation clear. Use colors to link equation terms to the visual elements on the 3D surface.
