The narrative begins with a vivid description of Newtonian mechanics, setting the stage for our journey into the depths of Minkowski Spacetime. We start with a 2D representation, transitioning smoothly into a 3D space as we introduce vectors, calculus, and multivariable calculus. Each concept builds upon the last, with partial derivatives and vector calculus leading us into the realm of electromagnetism. We explore electrostatics, magnetic fields, and magnetostatics, before diving into the induced electromotive force and Faraday's law of induction. Maxwell's equations bridge our understanding of electromagnetism with the speed of light, leading us to the heart of Special Relativity. As we progress, we touch upon classical mechanics and electromagnetism, before delving into the abstract worlds of vector spaces, linear algebra, and matrix multiplication. Our journey culminates in the exploration of multi-dimensional arrays and tensors, providing a solid foundation for understanding Minkowski Spacetime. Throughout the narrative, we pay close attention to the visual elements, color schemes, and animations that will bring each concept to life. The final summary prepares us for the next step: generating Manim code to visualize this incredible journey through spacetime.
