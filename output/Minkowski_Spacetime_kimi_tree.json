It was introduced by Albert Einstein in 1905 and has two key postulates: 1) The laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference, and 2) The speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion or the motion of the source of light. This leads to some counterintuitive effects, such as time dilation and length contraction, which are described by the equations above. The equation E=mc^2 shows that energy (E) and mass (m) are interchangeable, with the speed of light squared (c^2) as the conversion factor. The spacetime interval equation (\\Delta s^2) shows how distances and times can appear different to different observers moving relative to each other. The Lorentz factor (L) is used to calculate these effects.",

This means that time on the spaceship would pass 1.25 times slower than on Earth, and the length of the spaceship would contract by a factor of 1.25 in the direction of motion."

This leads to some counterintuitive effects, such as time dilation and length contraction, which are described by the equations above. The equation E=mc^2 shows that energy (E) and mass (m) are interchangeable, with the speed of light squared (c^2) as the conversion factor. The spacetime interval equation (\\Delta s^2) shows how distances and times can appear different to different observers moving relative to each other.

This leads to some counterintuitive effects, such as time dilation and length contraction, which are described by the equations above. The equation E=mc^2 shows that energy (E) and mass (m) are interchangeable, with the speed of light squared (c^2) as the conversion factor. The spacetime interval equation (\\Delta s^2) shows how distances and times can appear different to different observers moving relative to each other. The Lorentz factor (L) is used to calculate these effects.",

We start with a 2D representation, transitioning smoothly into a 3D space as we introduce vectors, calculus, and multivariable calculus. Each concept builds upon the last, with partial derivatives and vector calculus leading us into the realm of electromagnetism. We explore electrostatics, magnetic fields, and magnetostatics, before diving into the induced electromotive force and Faraday's law of induction. Maxwell's equations bridge our understanding of electromagnetism with the speed of light, leading us to the heart of Special Relativity. As we progress, we touch upon classical mechanics and electromagnetism, before delving into the abstract worlds of vector spaces, linear algebra, and matrix multiplication. Our journey culminates in the exploration of multi-dimensional arrays and tensors, providing a solid foundation for understanding Minkowski Spacetime. Throughout the narrative, we pay close attention to the visual elements, color schemes, and animations that will bring each concept to life. The final summary prepares us for the next step: generating Manim code to visualize this incredible journey through spacetime."
